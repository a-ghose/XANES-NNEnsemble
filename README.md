# XANES-NNEnsemble Notebooks
Notebooks from 2022 research in Brookhaven National Laboratory' SULI program. No datasets included.

A neural network ensemble was constructed using pytorch-lightning to predict the X-ray absorption spectra of various molecules. In the file 'notebooks/modelruns/ml_notebook.ipynb' there is a notebook going through runs of the ensemble, accuracy plots with error bars, and a Principle Component Analysis plot. These runs were done multiple times with plots located in the file, 'notebooks/PCA_analysis'.
